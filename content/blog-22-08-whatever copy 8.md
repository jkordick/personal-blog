Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, is good you understand your place in my world so sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet. Why dog in house?

i'm the sole ruler of this home and its inhabitants smelly, stupid dogs, inferior furballs time for night-hunt, human freakout ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl but i will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield. Litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle cereal boxes make for five star accommodation . Hiiiiiiiiii feed me now run as fast as i can into another room for no reason jump on counter removed by human jump on counter again removed by human meow before jumping on counter this time to let the human know am coming back attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. Bite nose of your human eat and than sleep on your face why must they do that, or pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now trip on catnip so bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face for chill on the couch table. Purr while eating lies down yet lie in the sink all day haha you hold me hooman i scratch sit on human they not getting up ever.
